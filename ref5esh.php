    <h1>the solution</h1>
    <p>Based on the case studies I performed, it became apparent that interest peaked in seeing the products in a real living environment, as opposed to a sales floor. Alternative methods of selling products became the best option; to sell from bars, coffee shops, and other locations where they could be used before ordering one of your own.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, my involvement in local non-profits became a fine enough cause for donating ref5esh products.</p>
