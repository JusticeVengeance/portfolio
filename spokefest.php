    <h1>The Challenge</h1>
    <p>Spokefest of Spokane hired me for a 6-month social media promotion. The challenge-sf was to promote the day of the bike ride on social media platforms so that we may increase the number of new and returning registrants.</p>

      <p>Through research, I gathered that the most sizable return came from relatable imagery which users were not likely to scroll past without first looking over.</p>

    <h1>the solution</h1>
    <p>Using this method, I could generate interest and maximize involvement with spokefest during community events prior to the day of the ride. Creating frequent incentive to register for spokefest would also motivate a constant flow of new registrants.</p>

  <div class="copy marker">
    <p>I kept a constant stream of imagery to serve as reminder for the upcoming ride and effectively install this year's theme, "Bring a Buddy".</p>

    <h1>The Result</h1>
    <p>All efforts to increase registrations were successful, Spokefest 2015 had many more returning riders than in years past. I believe this was a result of increased awareness of incentives to register.</p>
