    <h1>The Challenge</h1>
    <p>ATD Movement is an organized event crew from Salt Lake City. The founders were interested in testing the spokane scene. I was tasked with event promotion. The organization was familiar with a different demographic, and they needed to instead reach the students of college campuses in our area.</p>

    <p>Obstacles were encountered and adjustments were made to bring the event to fruition. Methods to raise attendance were very effective. </p>

    <h1>the solution</h1>
    <p>I thought the best course of action would be to hit the campus directly, so we set out a small booth and encouraged students to invite themselves to the event by liking ATD Movement on facebook. We handed out flyers with date and location information, and encouraged everyone to share their invite. </p>

      <p>Details for this event were a hot topic on social media, so I devised a way to inform followers of the way that the venue would be set up and organized. This tactic successfully helped shed light on some of the questions that were frequently being asked.</p>
      <p>Designs for the event were used in both print and social media.</p>

    <p>Creative methods of raising attendance were used, such as encouraging invitees to set our poster to their phone's lock screen and wallpaper.</p>

    <h1>The Result</h1>
    <p>The event successfully reached a level of attendance that was highly-satisfactory. ATD movement left spokane, very pleased with having organized an event, and someday wishes to return for another.</p>
